a)Unlocking Key.txt.gpg
Command-gpg --batch --passphrase Team2Wins100% -d Key.txt.gpg

b)Unlocking CTF.txt.gpg
Command-gpg --batch --passphrase PwnRound1 -d CTF.txt.gpg

Upon successful decryption,the player can get the clues to be used for the next round of challenges


                                                                          Round 2
                                                                            
Use RSA Algorithm with 4096 bits Public and Private key provided as the separate password protected file


                                                                          Round 3
                                                                           
 Use ROT13 to decrypt the text
 
                 
                                                                           Round 4

Use Vigenere Cipher with key as LOCKS to decrypt the text


                                                                           Round 5
                                                                           
                                    
Use Ceaser Cipher with a shift of 7 to encrypt the text
